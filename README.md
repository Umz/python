#   MAIL MERGE GOOGLE DRIVE

Adapted the original Python mail merge code because it didn't work out the box for me.
Used a mix of Google resources to build the working application.

Google Mail Merge Guide:

1-  SET up the google console for API access from your program (desktop)
2-  CREATE the sample document and sheet
3-  COPY in the document and sheet IDs
4-  Change the COLUMNS and keys to match mail merge data
5-  RUN the app and debug
